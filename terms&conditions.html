        <ol type="a">
            <br><br>
            <li>
                Changes to Terms: The Terms are subject to revisions at any time, as determined by us, and all changes are effective immediately upon being posted on the Platform. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically for any updates or changes. You will be deemed to have accepted the changes made to these Terms if you continue to use the Platform once it has been posted.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                Modification to the Services: We reserve the right at any time to add, modify, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof), with or without cause. We shall not be liable for any such addition, modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Services.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                Severability: If any provision of these Terms is determined by any court or other competent authority to be unlawful or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will continue to be in effect. If any unlawful or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if a part of it were deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that would contradict the clear intention of the clause, in which case the entirety of the relevant provision will be deemed to be deleted).
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                Assignment: You shall not license, sell, transfer, or assign your rights, obligations, or covenants under these Terms, or your Account in any manner without our prior written consent. We may grant or withhold this consent at our sole discretion, subject to any conditions we deem appropriate. We may assign our rights to any of our affiliates, subsidiaries, or parent companies, any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services, or any third party without any prior notice to you.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                Notices: All notices, requests, demands, and determinations for us under these Terms (other than routine operational communications) shall be sent to legal@urbancompany.com.

            <br><br>

            <li>
                Third Party Rights: No third party shall have any rights to enforce any terms contained herein.
            </li>
            <br><br>

            <li>
                Force Majeure: We shall have no liability to you if we are prevented from or delayed in performing our obligations, or from carrying on our business, by acts, events, omissions, or accidents beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation, strikes, failure of a utility service or telecommunications network, act of God, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, or compliance with any law or governmental order, rule, regulation, or direction.
